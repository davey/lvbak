LvBak - efficient backups of LVM volumes


With LvBak you can backup your LVM volumes easily and efficient in Linux.
LvBak is written in Ruby and can be used for free under the terms of the
GNU General Public License ( Open Source).

LvBak creates a new backup revision by hardlinking the previous backup and
updating that new revision with rsync - thats fast, space saving and 
efficient because only the changed files are copied. In contrast to
conventional incremental backups, you have always the full directory
tree of alle saved files of your filesystems in every backup revision.

LvBak is hostet on  GitHub.


The config file is expected to be /etc/lvbak.conf
See lvbak.conf.example for an example.
